No recorded peer feedback.
  
### Written checkin

25 / 25 points

The project you've chosen sounds really interesting, and the questions are compelling.  Please remember that you have to create **at least four data visualizations** that will end up in a poster to answer the questions you've chosen to explore.  Those data visualizations should use as many of the data visualization types and techniques that you have learned about as is practical, and should be tailored to be used in a poster presentation.  I think your dataset will facilitate this, but if you find that's not true please consider finding additional data! Overall, I think you're in good shape.

###  Draft figures

40 / 50 points

Feedback missing. Increase font size for plots 2 and 3.
  
### Draft version of poster

50 / 50 points
 
Overall, I like the layout of your poster and you have a good mix of visualizations. However, you need to ensure that the plots you’ve included have sufficiently large plot labels to be easily viewed when the poster is printed. Also, right now you have excess whitespace. Make sure you're maximizing how you're using your space, which might include just making your figures bigger and shifting around the text.

### Final version poster

8 / 10 Layout and Design  

Overall the lay out is clean and pretty easy to follow. It was a little unclear what order I should progress through the poster in, especially for the vidualizations.

10 / 10 Data Visualization  

Nice variety of visualizations and I liked the use of the coure layout in your heatmap. Label sizes were sufficiently large and easily legible.


7 / 10 Text content  

Text felt heavy with large block of text. Would have been useful to try to summarize the main take-aways from each plot in a set of succinct bullet points that were easy to digest.

10 / 10 Oral Presentation  

8 / 10 Overall achievement of goal  

I found your overall narrative to be pretty clear and I was able to extract your main findings, but it took a bit of work to digest all of the text and find the key nuggets of information.
 
47.2 / 50 sum of average peer review scores for all categories

**Peer comments**:

* Fidgeting and vocal ticks made it hard for me to understand a lot of his points. Additionally, I think most of the color schemes selected were unwise and unfit for this project. 
* I know nothing about basketball and I learned a lot
* Change to sequential color map for the first teo visualizations and reduce overall amount of text. 
* Movement while presenting was somewhat distracting. Lots of text for a poster. 
* Really well done! Maybe make it clear that figure 1 color is shots taken and not points per shot since color was the same. 
* VERY well done
* Presentation was a little hard to hear at times
* I really liked the visuals that showed where people take shots from.
